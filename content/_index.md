I am currently a Hall C Postdoctoral Fellow at Jefferson Lab.
My Research interest are exploring the partonic structure of nucleons.

I have obtained my Ph.D in Physics from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2024.
During my Ph.D, I worked on the [SeaQuest]({{< ref "/research/seaquest/index.md" >}}) experiment.
The primary goal of the experiment is to study the light sea-quark asymmetry in the proton. 
I have worked on the Drell-Yan cross section ratio analysis as well as the charmonium production cross section analysis.
