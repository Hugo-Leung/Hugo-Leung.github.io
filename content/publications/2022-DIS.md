The Fermilab SeaQuest experiment has measured dimuon events from the interactions of 120GeV proton beam on liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets with dimuon mass between 2 and 9GeV. These dimuon events contain both the Drell-Yan process and the charmonium ($J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$) production. Unlike the Drell-Yan process which probes the antiquark distributions in the nucleons, the charmonium production is sensitive to both quark and gluon distributions. SeaQuest has extracted the $\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$ ratio as well as the differential cross sections for charmonium production in the kinematic region of $0.4 < x_F < 0.9$. The $\sigma^{pd}/2\sigma^{pp}$ ratio for charmonium production are found to be significantly different from that of the Drell-Yan process. The measured differential cross sections for charmonium production are compared with theoretical calculations using Color Evaporation Model and Non-Relativistic QCD model.
