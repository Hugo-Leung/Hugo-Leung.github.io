SeaQuest has measured dimuon events from the interaction of 120 GeV proton beam on liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets with dimuon mass between 2 and 8 GeV. These dimuon events contain both the Drell-Yan process and the charmonium ($J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$) production. The first result of the Drell-Yan $(p+d)/2(p+p)$ cross section ratio, based on the analysis of a fraction of the collected data, has provided new information on the light sea quark asymmetry. Analysis of the entire data set to extract the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio is currently underway, and the status of this analysis will be reported. Unlike the Drell-Yan process which probes the antiquark distributions in the nucleons, the charmonium production is sensitive to both quark and gluon distributions. The status of the charmonium analysis will also be discussed.
